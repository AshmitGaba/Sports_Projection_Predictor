# **Sports_Projection_Predictor**

# Overview
This application serves as a digital assistant for sports betting enthusiasts, specifically for NBA games as of right now. By leveraging data from 1950 up to the present day, my proprietary algorithm predicts a player's future performance across multiple statistics. Whether you're interested in points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, or other statistics, my app has you covered.

Predictive Analytics: Get projections on how many of a certain statistic a player will score in an upcoming game.
Custom Filters:
